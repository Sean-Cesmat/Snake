# Snake
My Unit1 game project for WDI 17

# Instructions
Use the arrow keys to control the snake and collect the "food".
If you eat the "food", you will have 1 point added to your score.
If you hit your own tail, a barrier or the edge of the map (unless continuous borders is set to 'yes'), your turn ends.
The person with the highest score wins!


# Unsolved problems
- there is a small glitch after pausing where the snake is missing a sections for a second
